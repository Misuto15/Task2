Update CMS Blocks Sample from Weltpixel
=============================================================

We strip out contents of CMS Blocks Sample from Weltpixel that has {{widget}} type of "Magento/CatalogWidget",

from : *swift/app/code/WeltPixel/SampleData/fixtures/blocks/blocks.csv*

because it will create error during setup:upgrade process if the project does not have sample data installed.
Those 5 widgets are  :

* section_content1_v5
* section_content2_v5
* section_content3_v5
* latest_product_v8
* content5_shopnow_v10

Update them all after Swift installation by running SQL script located on :
###### sql/weltpixel_samplecmsblock_update_for_catalogwidget.sql
